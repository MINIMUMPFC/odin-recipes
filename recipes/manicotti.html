            <li>To make the crepes: in a large bowl, whisk together the ingredients until smooth.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a 6 inch skillet over medium het.</li>
            <li>Brush the pan lightly with oil.</li>
            <li>Holding the pan in one hand, spoon in about 1/3 cup of the crepe batter and immediately rotate and tilt the pan to completely cover the bottom.</li>
            <li>Pour any excess batter back into the bowl.</li>
            <li>Cook the crepe for one minute, or until the edges turn brown and begin to lift away from the pan.</li>
            <li>With your fingers, flip the crepe over, and cook for 30 seconds more, or until spotted with brown on the other side.</li>
            <li>Slide the cooked crepe onto a plate.</li>
            <li>Cover with a piece of wax paper.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, stacking the crepes and separating each one with a piece of wax paper (The crepes can be made up to 2 days ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and store in the fridge until ready to use).</li>
            <li>Turn the oven to 350.</li>
            <li>To make the filling: stir all the filling ingredients together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Then, to assemble: Spoon a thin layer of the marinara sauce into a 13x9x2 inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Place about 1/4 cup of the filling lengthwise down the center of a crepe, roll it up, and place it seam side down in the dish.</li>
